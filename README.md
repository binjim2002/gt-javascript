We are creating an app that is going to generate a Password for our user.

this pass word may have lower case letters, uppercase letter special charcters and numbers.
The password can only take between 8 to 128 characters.

1. Add if conditions for hasUpperCaseLEtters

2. Add if conditions for hasSpecialCharacters, haslowerCaseCharacter
  

3. Research .concat method for arrays. 
 
4. Run this loop Each time, grab a random number.
    
5. Use that number to pick a character from the possibleCharacters array

6. Add it to a newPassword

7. Return the new string here, instead of the hardcoded value "newPassword"
